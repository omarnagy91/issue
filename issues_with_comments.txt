Please make sure to complete all tasks and check them off once you do, or else your PR will not be merged!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I linked the correct issue in the `### Fixed Issues` section above\r\n- [x] I wrote clear testing steps that cover the changes made in this PR\r\n    - [x] I added steps for local testing in the `Tests` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for the expected offline behavior in the `Offline steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for Staging and/or Production testing in the `QA steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps to cover failure scenarios (i.e. verify an input displays the correct error message if the entered data is not correct)\r\n    - [x] I turned off my network connection and tested it while offline to ensure it matches the expected behavior (i.e. verify the default avatar icon is displayed if app is offline)\r\n    - [x] I tested this PR with a [High Traffic account](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#high-traffic-accounts) against the staging or production API to ensure there are no regressions (e.g. long loading states that impact usability).\r\n- [x] I included screenshots or videos for tests on [all platforms](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#make-sure-you-can-test-on-all-platforms)\r\n- [x] I ran the tests on **all platforms** & verified they passed on:\r\n    - [x] Android: Native\r\n    - [x] Android: mWeb Chrome\r\n    - [x] iOS: Native\r\n    - [x] iOS: mWeb Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Desktop\r\n- [x] I verified there are no console errors (if there's a console error not related to the PR, report it or open an issue for it to be fixed)\r\n- [x] I followed proper code patterns (see [Reviewing the code](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md#reviewing-the-code))\r\n    - [x] I verified that any callback methods that were added or modified are named for what the method does and never what callback they handle (i.e. `toggleReport` and not `onIconClick`)\r\n    - [x] I verified that the left part of a conditional rendering a React component is a boolean and NOT a string, e.g. `myBool && <MyComponent />`.\r\n    - [x] I verified that comments were added to code that is not self explanatory\r\n    - [x] I verified that any new or modified comments were clear, correct English, and explained \"why\" the code was doing something instead of only explaining \"what\" the code was doing.\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text shown in the product is localized by adding it to `src/languages/*` files and using the [translation method](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60)\r\n      - [x] If any non-english text was added/modified, I verified the translation was requested/reviewed in #expensify-open-source and it was approved by an internal Expensify engineer. Link to Slack message:\r\n    - [x] I verified all numbers, amounts, dates and phone numbers shown in the product are using the [localization methods](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60-L68)\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text that was added to the app is grammatically correct in English. It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/22219519/fc0b56cb-9e07-4e93-af6f-5f633d65e8af\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

Please make sure to complete all tasks and check them off once you do, or else your PR will not be merged!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I linked the correct issue in the `### Fixed Issues` section above\r\n- [x] I wrote clear testing steps that cover the changes made in this PR\r\n    - [x] I added steps for local testing in the `Tests` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for the expected offline behavior in the `Offline steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for Staging and/or Production testing in the `QA steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps to cover failure scenarios (i.e. verify an input displays the correct error message if the entered data is not correct)\r\n    - [x] I turned off my network connection and tested it while offline to ensure it matches the expected behavior (i.e. verify the default avatar icon is displayed if app is offline)\r\n    - [x] I tested this PR with a [High Traffic account](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#high-traffic-accounts) against the staging or production API to ensure there are no regressions (e.g. long loading states that impact usability).\r\n- [x] I included screenshots or videos for tests on [all platforms](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#make-sure-you-can-test-on-all-platforms)\r\n- [x] I ran the tests on **all platforms** & verified they passed on:\r\n    - [x] Android: Native\r\n    - [x] Android: mWeb Chrome\r\n    - [x] iOS: Native\r\n    - [x] iOS: mWeb Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Desktop\r\n- [x] I verified there are no console errors (if there's a console error not related to the PR, report it or open an issue for it to be fixed)\r\n- [x] I followed proper code patterns (see [Reviewing the code](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md#reviewing-the-code))\r\n    - [x] I verified that any callback methods that were added or modified are named for what the method does and never what callback they handle (i.e. `toggleReport` and not `onIconClick`)\r\n    - [x] I verified that the left part of a conditional rendering a React component is a boolean and NOT a string, e.g. `myBool && <MyComponent />`.\r\n    - [x] I verified that comments were added to code that is not self explanatory\r\n    - [x] I verified that any new or modified comments were clear, correct English, and explained \"why\" the code was doing something instead of only explaining \"what\" the code was doing.\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text shown in the product is localized by adding it to `src/languages/*` files and using the [translation method](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60)\r\n      - [x] If any non-english text was added/modified, I verified the translation was requested/reviewed in #expensify-open-source and it was approved by an internal Expensify engineer. Link to Slack message:\r\n    - [x] I verified all numbers, amounts, dates and phone numbers shown in the product are using the [localization methods](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60-L68)\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text that was added to the app is grammatically correct in English. It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 1 58 07\u202fPM](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/22219519/1635a6bc-fca3-46b9-9256-6e0f5fe90f73)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

Fixing the ending part of regex from where we allow upto 254 characters to 4 characters should fix the regex.\r\n2. Update package import to updated package.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nATTN: Contributor+\r\n\r\nYou are the first line of defense in making sure every proposal has a clear and easily understood problem with a \"root cause\".

Address each contributor proposal one at a time and address each part of the question one at a time e.g. if a solution looks acceptable, but the stated problem is not clear then you should provide feedback and make suggestions to improve each prompt before moving on to the next. Avoid responding to all sections of a proposal at once. Move from one question to the next each time asking the contributor to \"Please update your original proposal and tag me again when it's ready for review\".\r\n\r\n3. Limit excessive conversation and moderate issues to keep them on track. If someone is doing any of the following things please kindly and humbly course-correct them:\r\n\r\n- Posting PRs.\r\n- Posting large multi-line diffs (this is basically a PR).\r\n- Skipping any of the required questions.\r\n- Not using the proposal template at all.\r\n- Suggesting that an existing issue is related to the current issue before a problem or root cause has been established.\r\n- Excessively wordy explanations.\r\n\r\n4.

Link to Slack message:\r\n    - [x] I verified all numbers, amounts, dates and phone numbers shown in the product are using the [localization methods](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60-L68)\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text that was added to the app is grammatically correct in English. It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 12 55 45\u202fPM](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/22219519/1646d973-5fba-4079-a408-833dcb258002)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

Please make sure to complete all tasks and check them off once you do, or else your PR will not be merged!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] I linked the correct issue in the `### Fixed Issues` section above\r\n- [ ] I wrote clear testing steps that cover the changes made in this PR\r\n    - [ ] I added steps for local testing in the `Tests` section\r\n    - [ ] I added steps for the expected offline behavior in the `Offline steps` section\r\n    - [ ] I added steps for Staging and/or Production testing in the `QA steps` section\r\n    - [ ] I added steps to cover failure scenarios (i.e. verify an input displays the correct error message if the entered data is not correct)\r\n    - [ ] I turned off my network connection and tested it while offline to ensure it matches the expected behavior (i.e. verify the default avatar icon is displayed if app is offline)\r\n    - [ ] I tested this PR with a [High Traffic account](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#high-traffic-accounts) against the staging or production API to ensure there are no regressions (e.g. long loading states that impact usability).\r\n- [ ] I included screenshots or videos for tests on [all platforms](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#make-sure-you-can-test-on-all-platforms)\r\n- [ ] I ran the tests on **all platforms** & verified they passed on:\r\n    - [ ] Android: Native\r\n    - [ ] Android: mWeb Chrome\r\n    - [ ] iOS: Native\r\n    - [ ] iOS: mWeb Safari\r\n    - [ ] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\r\n    - [ ] MacOS: Desktop\r\n- [ ] I verified there are no console errors (if there's a console error not related to the PR, report it or open an issue for it to be fixed)\r\n- [ ] I followed proper code patterns (see [Reviewing the code](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md#reviewing-the-code))\r\n    - [ ] I verified that any callback methods that were added or modified are named for what the method does and never what callback they handle (i.e. `toggleReport` and not `onIconClick`)\r\n    - [ ] I verified that the left part of a conditional rendering a React component is a boolean and NOT a string, e.g. `myBool && <MyComponent />`.\r\n    - [ ] I verified that comments were added to code that is not self explanatory\r\n    - [ ] I verified that any new or modified comments were clear, correct English, and explained \"why\" the code was doing something instead of only explaining \"what\" the code was doing.\r\n    - [ ] I verified any copy / text shown in the product is localized by adding it to `src/languages/*` files and using the [translation method](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60)\r\n      - [ ] If any non-english text was added/modified, I verified the translation was requested/reviewed in #expensify-open-source and it was approved by an internal Expensify engineer. Link to Slack message:\r\n    - [ ] I verified all numbers, amounts, dates and phone numbers shown in the product are using the [localization methods](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60-L68)\r\n    - [ ] I verified any copy / text that was added to the app is grammatically correct in English. It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [ ] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [ ] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [ ] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [ ] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [ ] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [ ] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [ ] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [ ] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [ ] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [ ] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [ ] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [ ] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [ ] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [ ] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [ ] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [ ] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [ ] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [ ] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [ ] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I verified that this PR follows the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I verified other components that can be impacted by these changes have been tested, and I retested again (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` have been tested & I retested again)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] If a new component is created I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar component doesn't exist in the codebase\r\n    - [x] All props are defined accurately and each prop has a `/** comment above it */`\r\n    - [x] The file is named correctly\r\n    - [x] The component has a clear name that is non-ambiguous and the purpose of the component can be inferred from the name alone\r\n    - [x] The only data being stored in the state is data necessary for rendering and nothing else\r\n    - [x] For Class Components, any internal methods passed to components event handlers are bound to `this` properly so there are no scoping issues (i.e. for `onClick={this.submit}` the method `this.submit` should be bound to `this` in the constructor)\r\n    - [x] Any internal methods bound to `this` are necessary to be bound (i.e. avoid `this.submit = this.submit.bind(this);` if `this.submit` is never passed to a component event handler like `onClick`)\r\n    - [x] All JSX used for rendering exists in the render method\r\n    - [x] The component has the minimum amount of code necessary for its purpose, and it is broken down into smaller components in order to separate concerns and functions\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n- [x] I have checked off every checkbox in the PR reviewer checklist, including those that don't apply to this PR.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/97473779/59722b93-bf90-4e53-939a-0e071509165e\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/97473779/0bca7ae5-20a7-4629-8c50-d145f07c99f1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

Please make sure to complete all tasks and check them off once you do, or else your PR will not be merged!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I linked the correct issue in the `### Fixed Issues` section above\r\n- [x] I wrote clear testing steps that cover the changes made in this PR\r\n    - [x] I added steps for local testing in the `Tests` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for the expected offline behavior in the `Offline steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for Staging and/or Production testing in the `QA steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps to cover failure scenarios (i.e. verify an input displays the correct error message if the entered data is not correct)\r\n    - [x] I turned off my network connection and tested it while offline to ensure it matches the expected behavior (i.e. verify the default avatar icon is displayed if app is offline)\r\n    - [x] I tested this PR with a [High Traffic account](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#high-traffic-accounts) against the staging or production API to ensure there are no regressions (e.g. long loading states that impact usability).\r\n- [x] I included screenshots or videos for tests on [all platforms](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#make-sure-you-can-test-on-all-platforms)\r\n- [x] I ran the tests on **all platforms** & verified they passed on:\r\n    - [x] Android: Native\r\n    - [x] Android: mWeb Chrome\r\n    - [x] iOS: Native\r\n    - [x] iOS: mWeb Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Desktop\r\n- [x] I verified there are no console errors (if there's a console error not related to the PR, report it or open an issue for it to be fixed)\r\n- [x] I followed proper code patterns (see [Reviewing the code](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md#reviewing-the-code))\r\n    - [x] I verified that any callback methods that were added or modified are named for what the method does and never what callback they handle (i.e. `toggleReport` and not `onIconClick`)\r\n    - [x] I verified that the left part of a conditional rendering a React component is a boolean and NOT a string, e.g. `myBool && <MyComponent />`.\r\n    - [x] I verified that comments were added to code that is not self explanatory\r\n    - [x] I verified that any new or modified comments were clear, correct English, and explained \"why\" the code was doing something instead of only explaining \"what\" the code was doing.\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text shown in the product is localized by adding it to `src/languages/*` files and using the [translation method](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60)\r\n      - [x] If any non-english text was added/modified, I verified the translation was requested/reviewed in #expensify-open-source and it was approved by an internal Expensify engineer. Link to Slack message:\r\n    - [x] I verified all numbers, amounts, dates and phone numbers shown in the product are using the [localization methods](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60-L68)\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text that was added to the app is grammatically correct in English. It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/97676131/89fff15e-8158-411d-8c48-94ea41c53db8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

Link to Slack message:\r\n    - [x] I verified all numbers, amounts, dates and phone numbers shown in the product are using the [localization methods](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60-L68)\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text that was added to the app is grammatically correct in English. It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

Please make sure to complete all tasks and check them off once you do, or else your PR will not be merged!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I linked the correct issue in the `### Fixed Issues` section above\r\n- [x] I wrote clear testing steps that cover the changes made in this PR\r\n    - [x] I added steps for local testing in the `Tests` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for the expected offline behavior in the `Offline steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for Staging and/or Production testing in the `QA steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps to cover failure scenarios (i.e. verify an input displays the correct error message if the entered data is not correct)\r\n    - [x] I turned off my network connection and tested it while offline to ensure it matches the expected behavior (i.e. verify the default avatar icon is displayed if app is offline)\r\n    - [x] I tested this PR with a [High Traffic account](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#high-traffic-accounts) against the staging or production API to ensure there are no regressions (e.g. long loading states that impact usability).\r\n- [x] I included screenshots or videos for tests on [all platforms](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#make-sure-you-can-test-on-all-platforms)\r\n- [x] I ran the tests on **all platforms** & verified they passed on:\r\n    - [x] Android: Native\r\n    - [x] Android: mWeb Chrome\r\n    - [x] iOS: Native\r\n    - [x] iOS: mWeb Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Desktop\r\n- [x] I verified there are no console errors (if there's a console error not related to the PR, report it or open an issue for it to be fixed)\r\n- [x] I followed proper code patterns (see [Reviewing the code](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md#reviewing-the-code))\r\n    - [x] I verified that any callback methods that were added or modified are named for what the method does and never what callback they handle (i.e. `toggleReport` and not `onIconClick`)\r\n    - [x] I verified that the left part of a conditional rendering a React component is a boolean and NOT a string, e.g. `myBool && <MyComponent />`.\r\n    - [x] I verified that comments were added to code that is not self explanatory\r\n    - [x] I verified that any new or modified comments were clear, correct English, and explained \"why\" the code was doing something instead of only explaining \"what\" the code was doing.\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text shown in the product is localized by adding it to `src/languages/*` files and using the [translation method](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60)\r\n      - [x] If any non-english text was added/modified, I verified the translation was requested/reviewed in #expensify-open-source and it was approved by an internal Expensify engineer. Link to Slack message:\r\n    - [x] I verified all numbers, amounts, dates and phone numbers shown in the product are using the [localization methods](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60-L68)\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text that was added to the app is grammatically correct in English. It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

We're not setting the receipt.name to transaction receipt [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/e355608a9e0ee107abe06f610031c80f74ed8fa8/src/libs/actions/IOU.js#L494). This is supposed to be used as the file name in the transaction.\r\n2. In [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/e355608a9e0ee107abe06f610031c80f74ed8fa8/src/libs/actions/IOU.js#L153), we're not using the correct field of receipt, the correct field is `name` instead of `filename`\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n<!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS -->\r\n1. Add to [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/e355608a9e0ee107abe06f610031c80f74ed8fa8/src/libs/actions/IOU.js#L494)\r\n```\r\nreceiptObject.name = receipt.name;\r\n```\r\n2. Change `filename` to `name` [here](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/e355608a9e0ee107abe06f610031c80f74ed8fa8/src/libs/actions/IOU.js#L153)\r\n```\r\nfilename: receipt.name\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe split bill flow can be fixed similarly. \r\n\r\nThere's another issue, which is when we reload the page, we'll still see the `Download the file` button but clicking on it will open a blob with error. This is because blob cannot be persisted between page reload for security reason. If we want to fix this here, we need to check if the blob is still valid, if not do not show the `Download the file` button and the message can be adjusted a bit. Or we can still show the button but show a nice error dialog explaining the issue when the user clicks on it.\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\nA\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nATTN: Contributor+\r\n\r\nYou are the first line of defense in making sure every proposal has a clear and easily understood problem with a \"root cause\". Do not approve any proposals that lack a satisfying explanation to the first two prompts. It is CRITICALLY important that we understand the root cause at a minimum even if the solution doesn't directly address it. When we avoid this step we can end up solving the wrong problems entirely or just writing hacks and workarounds.\r\n\r\nInstructions for how to review a proposal:\r\n\r\n1. Address each contributor proposal one at a time and address each part of the question one at a time e.g. if a solution looks acceptable, but the stated problem is not clear then you should provide feedback and make suggestions to improve each prompt before moving on to the next. Avoid responding to all sections of a proposal at once. Move from one question to the next each time asking the contributor to \"Please update your original proposal and tag me again when it's ready for review\".\r\n\r\n2. Limit excessive conversation and moderate issues to keep them on track. If someone is doing any of the following things please kindly and humbly course-correct them:\r\n\r\n- Posting PRs.\r\n- Posting large multi-line diffs (this is basically a PR).\r\n- Skipping any of the required questions.\r\n- Not using the proposal template at all.\r\n- Suggesting that an existing issue is related to the current issue before a problem or root cause has been established.\r\n- Excessively wordy explanations.\r\n\r\n3. Choose the first proposal that has a reasonable answer to all the required questions.\r\n-->",

        "body": "### Details\r\nThis PR fixes two issues:\r\n1. The month in the title of the Expensify Card statement page is incorrect\r\n2. The Spanish statement title is translated incorrectly.\r\n\r\n1. -> When instantiate a `Date` object in JavaScript, the second argument for month is \"month index\", meaning January is represented as \"0\". When passing the month, you have to subtract one from it to instantiate `Date` with an accurate month.\r\n2. -> The code didn't have any translation set for the statement title. This PR adds that.\r\n\r\n### Fixed Issues\r\n$ https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/30743\r\nPROPOSAL: N/A\r\n\r\n### Tests / QA Steps (Internal and production QA)\r\n\r\n1. Login to NewDot with any account. (Because we're just checking the header part of the statement screen, you don't have to have an account with an Expensify Card.\r\n4. Go to `new.expensify.com/statements/202310`\r\n5. Confirm that the title of the statement is `October 2023 Statement`, not `November 2023 Statement`\r\n6. Change the preferred language to Spanish on `https://dev.new.expensify.com:8082/settings/preferences/language`\r\n7. Go back to `new.expensify.com/statements/202310`\r\n8. Check that the title is `Estado De Cuenta De Octubre 2023`\r\n\r\nIf you're testing this locally (developers), you will see something like the one screenshotted below. The statement screen is an OldDot page embedded inside an iframe. The browser security doesn't allow NewDot to display production OldDot inside an iframe of a local NewDot. You just need to confirm that the month displayed on the title is correct.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"200\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 8 30 32\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/98560306/7004274f-33e0-4bdf-94ac-b20ad873558d\">\r\n\r\n### Offline tests\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### PR Author Checklist\r\n<!--\r\nThis is a checklist for PR authors.

It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

It mainly arises from withNavigationFocus HOC as it re-renders the BaseOptionSelector tree including OptionsList . Adding a memo to OptionsList doesn\u2019t help as it\u2019s parent gets re-rendered due to the withNavigationFocus HOC.\nAlso, we notice that due to isFocused state value in ActionItemView the ReportActionsList re-renders which also adds the overhead to the rendering cycle as it recreates the instances of recordTimeToMeasureItemLayout and loadOlderChats which are passed as props to ReportActionsList \n\n# Solution \n\nWe can remove the withNavigationFocus HOC and add navigation listeners(focus, blur) in BaseOptionSelector and memoize OptionsListto not re-render when state is set in it\u2019s parent. We can avoid recreating instances of recordTimeToMeasureItemLayout and loadOlderChats by wrapping them in useCallbacks and memorizing ReportActionsList.\n\nBefore on 6x CPU throttle:\n\nSee profile-ranked-before\nSee profile-timeline-before\nSee recording-before\n\nAfter on 6x CPU throttle:\n\nSee profile-ranked-after\nSee profile-timeline-after\nSee recording-after\n\nThe results looks impressive as we are able to save more than 700ms for the commit that happens when we close the Search sidebar.",

But in this case because there's still message in the thread, the IOU report will not be deleted but there'll also not be any outstanding request\r\n\r\n### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?\r\n<!-- DO NOT POST CODE DIFFS -->\r\nUpdate `hasOutstandingChildRequest` to false as soon as IOU has no outstanding request. We can do that by checking the amounts of the transactions\r\n\r\n### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)\r\n\r\n**Reminder:** Please use plain English, be brief and avoid jargon. Feel free to use images, charts or pseudo-code if necessary. Do not post large multi-line diffs or write walls of text. Do not create PRs unless you have been hired for this job.\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nATTN: Contributor+\r\n\r\nYou are the first line of defense in making sure every proposal has a clear and easily understood problem with a \"root cause\". Do not approve any proposals that lack a satisfying explanation to the first two prompts. It is CRITICALLY important that we understand the root cause at a minimum even if the solution doesn't directly address it. When we avoid this step we can end up solving the wrong problems entirely or just writing hacks and workarounds.\r\n\r\nInstructions for how to review a proposal:\r\n\r\n1. Address each contributor proposal one at a time and address each part of the question one at a time e.g. if a solution looks acceptable, but the stated problem is not clear then you should provide feedback and make suggestions to improve each prompt before moving on to the next. Avoid responding to all sections of a proposal at once. Move from one question to the next each time asking the contributor to \"Please update your original proposal and tag me again when it's ready for review\".\r\n\r\n2. Limit excessive conversation and moderate issues to keep them on track. If someone is doing any of the following things please kindly and humbly course-correct them:\r\n\r\n- Posting PRs.\r\n- Posting large multi-line diffs (this is basically a PR).\r\n- Skipping any of the required questions.\r\n- Not using the proposal template at all.\r\n- Suggesting that an existing issue is related to the current issue before a problem or root cause has been established.\r\n- Excessively wordy explanations.\r\n\r\n3. Choose the first proposal that has a reasonable answer to all the required questions.\r\n-->",

Please make sure to complete all tasks and check them off once you do, or else your PR will not be merged!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I linked the correct issue in the `### Fixed Issues` section above\r\n- [ ] I wrote clear testing steps that cover the changes made in this PR\r\n    - [ ] I added steps for local testing in the `Tests` section\r\n    - [ ] I added steps for the expected offline behavior in the `Offline steps` section\r\n    - [ ] I added steps for Staging and/or Production testing in the `QA steps` section\r\n    - [ ] I added steps to cover failure scenarios (i.e. verify an input displays the correct error message if the entered data is not correct)\r\n    - [ ] I turned off my network connection and tested it while offline to ensure it matches the expected behavior (i.e. verify the default avatar icon is displayed if app is offline)\r\n    - [ ] I tested this PR with a [High Traffic account](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#high-traffic-accounts) against the staging or production API to ensure there are no regressions (e.g. long loading states that impact usability).\r\n- [ ] I included screenshots or videos for tests on [all platforms](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#make-sure-you-can-test-on-all-platforms)\r\n- [ ] I ran the tests on **all platforms** & verified they passed on:\r\n    - [ ] Android: Native\r\n    - [ ] Android: mWeb Chrome\r\n    - [ ] iOS: Native\r\n    - [ ] iOS: mWeb Safari\r\n    - [ ] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\r\n    - [ ] MacOS: Desktop\r\n- [ ] I verified there are no console errors (if there's a console error not related to the PR, report it or open an issue for it to be fixed)\r\n- [x] I followed proper code patterns (see [Reviewing the code](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md#reviewing-the-code))\r\n    - [x] I verified that any callback methods that were added or modified are named for what the method does and never what callback they handle (i.e. `toggleReport` and not `onIconClick`)\r\n    - [x] I verified that the left part of a conditional rendering a React component is a boolean and NOT a string, e.g. `myBool && <MyComponent />`.\r\n    - [x] I verified that comments were added to code that is not self explanatory\r\n    - [x] I verified that any new or modified comments were clear, correct English, and explained \"why\" the code was doing something instead of only explaining \"what\" the code was doing.\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text shown in the product is localized by adding it to `src/languages/*` files and using the [translation method](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60)\r\n      - [x] If any non-english text was added/modified, I verified the translation was requested/reviewed in #expensify-open-source and it was approved by an internal Expensify engineer. Link to Slack message:\r\n    - [x] I verified all numbers, amounts, dates and phone numbers shown in the product are using the [localization methods](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60-L68)\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text that was added to the app is grammatically correct in English. It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

Please postfix `$` with a URL link to the GitHub issue this Pull Request is fixing. For example, `$ https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/<issueID>`.\r\n2. Please postfix  `PROPOSAL:` with a URL link to your GitHub comment, which contains the approved proposal (i.e. the proposal that was approved by Expensify).

Please make sure to complete all tasks and check them off once you do, or else your PR will not be merged!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I linked the correct issue in the `### Fixed Issues` section above\r\n- [x] I wrote clear testing steps that cover the changes made in this PR\r\n    - [x] I added steps for local testing in the `Tests` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for the expected offline behavior in the `Offline steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for Staging and/or Production testing in the `QA steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps to cover failure scenarios (i.e. verify an input displays the correct error message if the entered data is not correct)\r\n    - [x] I turned off my network connection and tested it while offline to ensure it matches the expected behavior (i.e. verify the default avatar icon is displayed if app is offline)\r\n    - [x] I tested this PR with a [High Traffic account](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#high-traffic-accounts) against the staging or production API to ensure there are no regressions (e.g. long loading states that impact usability).\r\n- [x] I included screenshots or videos for tests on [all platforms](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#make-sure-you-can-test-on-all-platforms)\r\n- [x] I ran the tests on **all platforms** & verified they passed on:\r\n    - [x] Android: Native\r\n    - [x] Android: mWeb Chrome\r\n    - [x] iOS: Native\r\n    - [x] iOS: mWeb Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Desktop\r\n- [x] I verified there are no console errors (if there's a console error not related to the PR, report it or open an issue for it to be fixed)\r\n- [x] I followed proper code patterns (see [Reviewing the code](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md#reviewing-the-code))\r\n    - [x] I verified that any callback methods that were added or modified are named for what the method does and never what callback they handle (i.e. `toggleReport` and not `onIconClick`)\r\n    - [x] I verified that the left part of a conditional rendering a React component is a boolean and NOT a string, e.g. `myBool && <MyComponent />`.\r\n    - [x] I verified that comments were added to code that is not self explanatory\r\n    - [x] I verified that any new or modified comments were clear, correct English, and explained \"why\" the code was doing something instead of only explaining \"what\" the code was doing.\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text shown in the product is localized by adding it to `src/languages/*` files and using the [translation method](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60)\r\n      - [x] If any non-english text was added/modified, I verified the translation was requested/reviewed in #expensify-open-source and it was approved by an internal Expensify engineer. Link to Slack message:\r\n    - [x] I verified all numbers, amounts, dates and phone numbers shown in the product are using the [localization methods](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60-L68)\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text that was added to the app is grammatically correct in English. It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\nno screenshots\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\nno screenshots\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\nno screenshots\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\nno screenshots\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\nno screenshots\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\nno screenshots\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

You'll only have to do this once, and this is how we'll hire you on Upwork.\nPlease follow these steps:\n1. Make sure you've read and understood the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n2. Get the email address used to login to your Expensify account. If you don't already have an Expensify account, create one [here](https://new.expensify.com/). If you have multiple accounts (e.g. one for testing), please use your main account email.\n3. Get the link to your Upwork profile. It's necessary because we only pay via Upwork. You can access it by logging in, and then clicking on your name. It'll look like [this](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01ca8ad8ce36b9eceb). If you don't already have an account, sign up for one [here](https://www.upwork.com/nx/signup/?dest=home).\n4. Copy the format below and paste it in a comment on this issue.

(Optional)\r\nNA\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nATTN: Contributor+\r\n\r\nYou are the first line of defense in making sure every proposal has a clear and easily understood problem with a \"root cause\". Do not approve any proposals that lack a satisfying explanation to the first two prompts. It is CRITICALLY important that we understand the root cause at a minimum even if the solution doesn't directly address it. When we avoid this step we can end up solving the wrong problems entirely or just writing hacks and workarounds.\r\n\r\nInstructions for how to review a proposal:\r\n\r\n1. Address each contributor proposal one at a time and address each part of the question one at a time e.g. if a solution looks acceptable, but the stated problem is not clear then you should provide feedback and make suggestions to improve each prompt before moving on to the next. Avoid responding to all sections of a proposal at once. Move from one question to the next each time asking the contributor to \"Please update your original proposal and tag me again when it's ready for review\".\r\n\r\n2. Limit excessive conversation and moderate issues to keep them on track. If someone is doing any of the following things please kindly and humbly course-correct them:\r\n\r\n- Posting PRs.\r\n- Posting large multi-line diffs (this is basically a PR).\r\n- Skipping any of the required questions.\r\n- Not using the proposal template at all.\r\n- Suggesting that an existing issue is related to the current issue before a problem or root cause has been established.\r\n- Excessively wordy explanations.\r\n\r\n3. Choose the first proposal that has a reasonable answer to all the required questions.\r\n-->",

Please postfix `$` with a URL link to the GitHub issue this Pull Request is fixing. For example, `$ https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/<issueID>`.\r\n2. Please postfix  `PROPOSAL:` with a URL link to your GitHub comment, which contains the approved proposal (i.e. the proposal that was approved by Expensify).  For example, `PROPOSAL: https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/<issueID>#issuecomment-1369752925`\r\n\r\nDo NOT add the special GH keywords like `fixed` etc, we have our own process of managing the flow.\r\nIt MUST be an entire link to the github issue and your comment proposal ; otherwise, the linking and its automation will not work as expected.\r\n\r\nMake sure this section looks similar to this (you can link multiple issues using the same formatting, just add a new line):\r\n\r\n$ https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/<issueID>\r\n$ https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/<issueID(comment)>\r\n\r\nDo NOT only link the issue number like this: $ #<issueID>\r\n--->\r\n$ https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/31694\r\nPROPOSAL: N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n<!---\r\nAdd a numbered list of manual tests you performed that validates your changes work on all platforms, and that there are no regressions present.\r\nAdd any additional test steps if test steps are unique to a particular platform.\r\nManual test steps should be written so that your reviewer can repeat and verify one or more expected outcomes in the development environment.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n1.

Search -> Refer a friend, get $250. -> Referral page\r\n\r\n- [x] Verify that no errors appear in the JS console\r\n\r\n### Offline tests\r\n<!---\r\nAdd any relevant steps that validate your changes work as expected in a variety of network states e.g. \"offline\", \"spotty connection\", \"slow internet\", etc. Manual test steps should be written so that your reviewer and QA testers can repeat and verify one or more expected outcomes. If you are unsure how the behavior should work ask for advice in the `#expensify-open-source` Slack channel.\r\n--->\r\nSame as \"**Tests**\".\r\n\r\n### QA Steps\r\n<!---\r\nAdd a numbered list of manual tests that can be performed by our QA engineers on the staging environment to validate that your changes work on all platforms, and that there are no regressions present.\r\nAdd any additional QA steps if test steps are unique to a particular platform.\r\nManual test steps should be written so that the QA engineer can repeat and verify one or more expected outcomes in the staging environment.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n1.

Please make sure to complete all tasks and check them off once you do, or else your PR will not be merged!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I linked the correct issue in the `### Fixed Issues` section above\r\n- [x] I wrote clear testing steps that cover the changes made in this PR\r\n    - [x] I added steps for local testing in the `Tests` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for the expected offline behavior in the `Offline steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for Staging and/or Production testing in the `QA steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps to cover failure scenarios (i.e. verify an input displays the correct error message if the entered data is not correct)\r\n    - [x] I turned off my network connection and tested it while offline to ensure it matches the expected behavior (i.e. verify the default avatar icon is displayed if app is offline)\r\n    - [x] I tested this PR with a [High Traffic account](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#high-traffic-accounts) against the staging or production API to ensure there are no regressions (e.g. long loading states that impact usability).\r\n- [x] I included screenshots or videos for tests on [all platforms](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#make-sure-you-can-test-on-all-platforms)\r\n- [x] I ran the tests on **all platforms** & verified they passed on:\r\n    - [x] Android: Native\r\n    - [x] Android: mWeb Chrome\r\n    - [x] iOS: Native\r\n    - [x] iOS: mWeb Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Desktop\r\n- [x] I verified there are no console errors (if there's a console error not related to the PR, report it or open an issue for it to be fixed)\r\n- [x] I followed proper code patterns (see [Reviewing the code](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md#reviewing-the-code))\r\n    - [x] I verified that any callback methods that were added or modified are named for what the method does and never what callback they handle (i.e. `toggleReport` and not `onIconClick`)\r\n    - [x] I verified that the left part of a conditional rendering a React component is a boolean and NOT a string, e.g. `myBool && <MyComponent />`.\r\n    - [x] I verified that comments were added to code that is not self explanatory\r\n    - [x] I verified that any new or modified comments were clear, correct English, and explained \"why\" the code was doing something instead of only explaining \"what\" the code was doing.\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text shown in the product is localized by adding it to `src/languages/*` files and using the [translation method](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60)\r\n      - [x] If any non-english text was added/modified, I verified the translation was requested/reviewed in #expensify-open-source and it was approved by an internal Expensify engineer. Link to Slack message:\r\n    - [x] I verified all numbers, amounts, dates and phone numbers shown in the product are using the [localization methods](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60-L68)\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text that was added to the app is grammatically correct in English. It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\nNot required\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\nNot required\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\nNot required\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\nNot required\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\nNot required\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\nNot required\r\n</details>\r\n",

It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I verified that this PR follows the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I verified other components that can be impacted by these changes have been tested, and I retested again (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` have been tested & I retested again)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] If a new component is created I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar component doesn't exist in the codebase\r\n    - [x] All props are defined accurately and each prop has a `/** comment above it */`\r\n    - [x] The file is named correctly\r\n    - [x] The component has a clear name that is non-ambiguous and the purpose of the component can be inferred from the name alone\r\n    - [x] The only data being stored in the state is data necessary for rendering and nothing else\r\n    - [x] For Class Components, any internal methods passed to components event handlers are bound to `this` properly so there are no scoping issues (i.e. for `onClick={this.submit}` the method `this.submit` should be bound to `this` in the constructor)\r\n    - [x] Any internal methods bound to `this` are necessary to be bound (i.e. avoid `this.submit = this.submit.bind(this);` if `this.submit` is never passed to a component event handler like `onClick`)\r\n    - [x] All JSX used for rendering exists in the render method\r\n    - [x] The component has the minimum amount of code necessary for its purpose, and it is broken down into smaller components in order to separate concerns and functions\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n- [x] I have checked off every checkbox in the PR reviewer checklist, including those that don't apply to this PR.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n<img width=\"436\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-25 at 12 28 25 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/dae1fd28-6ee1-42c1-8a66-0b0d36682d2e\">\r\n<img width=\"436\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-25 at 12 28 55 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/78ad2048-244b-438e-aa15-a45d8fe73228\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n<img width=\"436\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 10 36 43 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/be616078-8d5b-4952-ac9e-6dbc38a42ca6\">\r\n<img width=\"436\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 10 41 47 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/a0a9e57b-0e1c-4ded-92a0-d6fc14b3b894\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n<img width=\"416\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 9 54 01 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/9af3f890-b3a1-42c8-a026-1a151c7f8310\">\r\n<img width=\"460\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 10 12 03 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/f3ac1fc8-c327-4531-8f2a-48f0d4ef7622\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n<img width=\"477\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 10 13 44 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/95d3e7cb-029c-4747-a803-36997a782663\">\r\n<img width=\"433\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 10 14 17 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/bd165fa5-c7e6-4ce4-9b18-a87d5ddb9028\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n<img width=\"1159\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 9 48 11 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/ebb2176c-6cdf-4eff-9f08-b19ebf7f96bd\">\r\n<img width=\"1159\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 9 49 14 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/18c24259-cf74-4456-919b-4dea0768c887\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n<img width=\"1215\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 10 54 51 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/3cc25488-e580-4522-9435-6f37bf4875d5\">\r\n<img width=\"1215\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 10 55 15 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/36869046/f002b881-2f7d-48e8-80b6-0c5bfd061bfd\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n![android2](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/54f6b8b8-febe-4d1e-9995-9d337a49c837)\r\n![android1](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/9b75c7ac-c669-47d4-921e-b88bc5e71292)\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n![android_web1](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/566bedba-8f02-46ae-9d96-904b502d96b0)\r\n![android_web2](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/1ab778ff-4a62-4df5-9722-1a5af8b29d96)\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n![ios2](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/d7fd22cd-f485-4e07-bdc6-3c003c5e2022)\r\n![ios1](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/6625438c-c3c1-459f-9327-64a424e00b77)\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n![ios_web2](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/a8042353-fcd0-433b-b059-50d3334b45b6)\r\n![ios_web1](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/02e97351-79dc-4109-b3bf-9ca799626295)\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n<img width=\"1296\" alt=\"web2\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/eca7a42d-9455-49b4-b9b5-678bdbadbddc\">\r\n<img width=\"1297\" alt=\"web1\" src=\"https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/c3666092-f4ad-47f9-bedc-c14ee797b23c\">\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n![desktop2](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/ce228c06-8985-4340-b128-e67b94d1351d)\r\n![desktop1](https://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/23176449/27f19aeb-1147-4540-b731-e05d4971652c)\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

Please make sure to complete all tasks and check them off once you do, or else your PR will not be merged!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I linked the correct issue in the `### Fixed Issues` section above\r\n- [x] I wrote clear testing steps that cover the changes made in this PR\r\n    - [x] I added steps for local testing in the `Tests` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for the expected offline behavior in the `Offline steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for Staging and/or Production testing in the `QA steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps to cover failure scenarios (i.e. verify an input displays the correct error message if the entered data is not correct)\r\n    - [x] I turned off my network connection and tested it while offline to ensure it matches the expected behavior (i.e. verify the default avatar icon is displayed if app is offline)\r\n    - [x] I tested this PR with a [High Traffic account](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#high-traffic-accounts) against the staging or production API to ensure there are no regressions (e.g. long loading states that impact usability).\r\n- [x] I included screenshots or videos for tests on [all platforms](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#make-sure-you-can-test-on-all-platforms)\r\n- [x] I ran the tests on **all platforms** & verified they passed on:\r\n    - [x] Android: Native\r\n    - [x] Android: mWeb Chrome\r\n    - [x] iOS: Native\r\n    - [x] iOS: mWeb Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Desktop\r\n- [x] I verified there are no console errors (if there's a console error not related to the PR, report it or open an issue for it to be fixed)\r\n- [x] I followed proper code patterns (see [Reviewing the code](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md#reviewing-the-code))\r\n    - [x] I verified that any callback methods that were added or modified are named for what the method does and never what callback they handle (i.e. `toggleReport` and not `onIconClick`)\r\n    - [x] I verified that the left part of a conditional rendering a React component is a boolean and NOT a string, e.g. `myBool && <MyComponent />`.\r\n    - [x] I verified that comments were added to code that is not self explanatory\r\n    - [x] I verified that any new or modified comments were clear, correct English, and explained \"why\" the code was doing something instead of only explaining \"what\" the code was doing.\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text shown in the product is localized by adding it to `src/languages/*` files and using the [translation method](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60)\r\n      - [x] If any non-english text was added/modified, I verified the translation was requested/reviewed in #expensify-open-source and it was approved by an internal Expensify engineer. Link to Slack message:\r\n    - [x] I verified all numbers, amounts, dates and phone numbers shown in the product are using the [localization methods](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60-L68)\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text that was added to the app is grammatically correct in English. It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is approved by marketing by adding the `Waiting for Copy` label for a copy review on the original GH to get the correct copy.\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/StyleUtils.js) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(themeColors.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/13826499/250b67e2-90b2-48ac-afc3-94abad090cde\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/13826499/bc6d9f5a-7bd0-43f2-b929-6792ab2d7467\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/13826499/e51251d0-4826-4609-b58f-1805af218be1\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/13826499/cf0e7c60-d9b0-4152-9508-3e59ba1056bb\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/13826499/27f3a665-6c6d-49cd-8871-bcc2a873b245\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Expensify/App/assets/13826499/e8d30c6f-c7c3-4000-a04d-3f7a70900d0b\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",
